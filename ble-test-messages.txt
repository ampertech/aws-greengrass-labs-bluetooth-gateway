The below BLE device command samples are supported by the ESP32 micropython sample code 
to provide a response or action the request on the uController.

1. Request Describe BLE Device message:
 {
  "command" : "describe-ble-device"
}

2. Toggle LED:
{
  "command" : "toggle_led"
}

2. Request BLE Device Processor Board Temperature
{
  "command" : "get-processor-board-temp"
}

4. Request a HW reset of the BLE devices. 
{
  "command" : "hw-reset-micro"
}
