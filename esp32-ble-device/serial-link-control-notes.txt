### Raspberry Pi USB connection to ESP32 Serial and Flash control
###

## Serial Terminal using SCREEN

## To connect to serial interface (assuming ESP connect to Pi USB)
# Note: May need to press boot button to get the terminal
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# Note: On Mac or linux the serial tty interface will be different.
# i.e: On mac: /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART

# to Exit Screen session
ctl a, d

# To load new Micropythin version:
# Note: Don't click the boot button. should make the connection after a few seconds.
cd [to dir with uPy imaage]
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-20210902-v1.17.bin

## To access Flash as mounted directory using RSHELL
rshell -p /dev/ttyUSB0

# ESP32 Flash will be mounted at /pyboard

# To see ESP32 loaded files
ls -l /pyboard

# To delete, move, etc just as normal file system
rm /pyboard/some-file
mv /pyboard/some-file

# or can cd into the directory
cd /pyboard

# To upload ESP32 code just copy as mormal
cd esp32-ble-peripheral
cp main.py /pyboard
cp -r ble /pyboard

# To exit RSHELL
ctl a, \
